I'm not too proud of this code, there's parts which are really hard to understand. Probably the worst mistake I made was making the
displayships variables (the objects which store the properties of the ships during the ship-placing phase) global variables, they should've 
been placed inside of the Human class.
The hardest thing about reading this code is finding out what does what. It's been so long since I wrote the code, I can't remember how
everything works, so putting notes on everything would be a pretty tedious task.
You might find some tools in the code, but this isn't something to study.
